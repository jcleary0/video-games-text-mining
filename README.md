# Amazon Video Game Reviews — Text Analytics & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Online customer reviews play a critical role in shaping consumer purchasing decisions and influencing product success, particularly in large digital marketplaces such as Amazon. These reviews contain vast amounts of unstructured textual data that reflect customer experiences, opinions, and satisfaction levels. Effectively analyzing this text at scale requires the application of text mining and machine learning techniques.

This project applies an end-to-end text analytics workflow to the Amazon Video Game Reviews dataset, transforming raw review text into structured, actionable insights. The analysis leverages both unsupervised and supervised learning methods to explore patterns in customer feedback and predict review characteristics based on textual content.
